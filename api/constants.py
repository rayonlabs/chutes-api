# Price multiplier to convert compute unit pricing to per-million token pricing.
# This is a bit tricky, since we allow different node selectors potentially for
# any particular model, e.g. you could run a llama 8b on 1 node or 8, so the price
# per million really can change depending on the node selector.
# For example:
#  llama-3-8b with node selector requiring minimally an h100
#  Example h100 hourly price (subject to change): $1.5
#  $/million = $1.5 * 0.01358695 = $0.02/million input
#            = $1.5 * 0.05434782 = $0.08/million output
# Deepseek example, 8x h200:
#  $2.3 * 8 * 0.01358695 = $0.25/million input
#  $2.3 * 8 * 0.05434782 = $1.00/million output
# NOTE: there is also a multiplier when the chute's concurrency is < 16,
# because for example the concurrency may be reduced to accomodate more
# total concurrent tokens in KV cache, such as GLM-4.5-FP8 at full context
# has concurrency 12, so:
#  $2.3 * 8 * 16/12 * 0.01358695 = $0.33/million input
#  $2.3 * 8 * 16/12 * 0.05434782 = $1.33/million output
# Kimi-K2 example (8xb200)
#  $3.5 * 8 * 0.01358695 = $0.38
#  $3.5 * 8 * 0.05434782 = $1.52
